# libdanrfid
### RFID tags in libraries  
..contain mainly an item code, a library and country code. libdanrfid is meant to become a swiss army knife when dealing with tag content. Currently supported is the danish data model DDM and a bibliotheca coding called DM11.

If there were a reference implementation, vendors could easily check compliance of their model against it.
