# libdanrfid
### RFID tags in libraries  
..contain mainly an item code, a library and country code. libdanrfid is meant to become a swiss army knife when dealing with tag content widely known as danish data model.

### Whats the goal?

This library shall provide a reference implementation dealing with the different implementations of the Danish Data Model. While providing a quite strict definition, tags often cannot be interchanged between institutions. If there were a reference implementation, vendors could easily check compliance of their model against it.
